New Media 105 - Creative Coding - Lab 10 4/19/23

In this excercise we used our knowledge of classes and objects to make a basic version of the frogger game. My version has a start and an end, and 5 lanes.

EX1: We drew the background for the basic Frogger Game. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/-jB4yP1mF

EX 2:  We made the cars for for the game. these are objects that spawn and move a random direction across the screen, looping back to the other side when they go off the edge of the screen. In hindsight, i should have programmed in tiles so that I wouldn't have to use the hardcoded value height/the number of lanes so much. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/4nz4IxXgn

EX 3: We made the frog for the game. This is an object that, when the arrow keys are pressed, hops around, moving a set distance each time. It cannot interact with the cars, as I did not have enough time to implement that. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/-TAZGmzif
